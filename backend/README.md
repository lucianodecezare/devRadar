First of all you'll have to install the packages.

```shell
$ yarn install
```

Then you'll need to configure your `mongoDB`. Here I'm using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/).

Rename `sample.env` to `.env` and change `DB_STRING` to your connection string value.

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

Voil√†!
